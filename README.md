# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7

## 1. Overview - The purpose of this project was to help the company Pewlett-Hackard find out which of there employees was 
getting ready for retirement.  By using the 6 tables of data we were given, we could help find out which departments would
be effected the most by the "silver tsnumai" so they could plan.

## 2. Results -
	- Looking at our retiring_title.csv we can see that almost 50,000! retiring employees are either Senior Staff or Senior
	  Engineers.  
	- We can see from out mentorship_eligibilty table we created that we only have about 1,550 eligible employees to take 
	  over the roles.  The company may need to think about widenining the age from just people born in 1965.

## 3. Summary - 
	- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
	- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
